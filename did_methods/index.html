    <p>KERI provides a means for secure and decentralised key management. This specification defines a DID method based
        on KERI.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure is a system for secure self-certifying Identifiers which aims at minimum
        sufficiency and maximum security. It defines mechanisms for proving the Root of Trust for self-certifying
        Identifiers and their associated Key State. This spec defines a transform from Key State to DID Document, such
        that any valid Key Event Log can be processed into a DID Document.</p>

    <p>A close analogy is <tt>did:peer</tt>, except that where the data model of <tt>did:peer</tt> is a DID Document and JSON patches on
        said Document, the basic data model of <tt>did:keri</tt> is an append-only log of Key Events. KERI-based
        Identifiers are suitable for both any-wise and n-wise purposes.</p>

    <h2>Concepts</h2>


    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>
            A Key Event is an atomic transaction over the Key State of an Identifier. While all events have some
            semantic meaning within KERI, only a subset will change the keys in a Key State (rotation and delegated rotation).
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Key Event Log</h3>
        <p>
            The Key Event Log is a type of hash-chained data structure from which the Key State of an Identifier can be
            derived. It can always be used to recreate the state at any point ("event-sourcing").
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="normative">
        <h3>Key Event Receipt Log</h3>
        <p>
            The Key Event Receipt Logs are built from receipts of events signed by the witnesses of those events (these
            are called <code>commitments</code>); these are also append-only but not hash-chained.
        </p>

    </section>
    <section class="normative" id="keyState">
        <h3>Key State</h3>
        <p>
            Key State represents the current values for the keys, witnesses and thresholds for a given identifier, signed by a provider.
            The signature from the provider signifies that the provider has verified the KEL for the identifier and the result of that
            verification is the key state.  The key state is represented in a Key State Notification Message detailed fully in
            <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0003.md#key-state-messages">Event Serialization Key State Messages</a>.
            The following fields are defined for a Key State Notification Message:
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>v</code>:	Version String</li>
                <li><code>i</code>: Identifier Prefix</li>
                <li><code>s</code>:	Sequence Number</li>
                <li><code>t</code>:	Message Type</li>
                <li><code>d</code>:	Event Digest (Seal or Receipt)</li>
                <li><code>p</code>:	Prior Event Digest</li>
                <li><code>kt</code>: Keys Signing Threshold</li>
                <li><code>k</code>:	List of Signing Keys (ordered key set)</li>
                <li><code>n</code>:	Next Key Set Commitment</li>
                <li><code>wt</code>: Witnessing Threshold</li>
                <li><code>w</code>:	List of Witnesses (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>wr</code>: List of Witnesses to Remove (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>wa</code>: List of Witnesses to Add (ordered witness set)</li>
                <li><code>c</code>:	List of Configuration Traits/Modes</li>
                <li><code>a</code>:	List of Anchors (seals)</li>
                <li><code>da</code>: Delegator Anchor Seal in Delegated Event (Location Seal)</li>
                <li><code>di</code>: Delegator Identifier Prefix in Key State</li>
                <li><code>rd</code>: Merkle Tree Root Digest</li>
                <li><code>e</code>:	Last received Event Map in Key State</li>
                <li><code>ee</code>: Last Establishment Event Map in Key State</li>
                <li><code>vn</code>: Version Number ("major.minor")</li>
            </ul>

        <p>
            Key state notification messages differ depending on the transferability of the the prefix signer and whether
            the signer is using a delegated identifier.  The follow examples detail the fields needed for each permutation.

    <h3>The DID Document</h3>
    <p>
        Optionally, a public key could be the only thing in the DID Doc (for interop with other W3C DID components and
        systems). Technically, it could be empty if only being used to prove DID control.
    </p>
    <p>
        Non-normative note: multiple namespaces using the same DID method could prove control or replay history for one
        controlling keypair that has been used across multiple ledgers. KERL logs could be stored in a secondary root of
        trust (i.e., a ledger), and similar or identical resolver metadata could be returned by querying the same
        identifier there.
    </p>

    <h2>The did:keri Format</h2>
    <p>The format for the <tt>did:keri</tt> method conforms to the [[DID-CORE]]
        specification and is simple. It consists of the <code>did:keri:</code> prefix,
        followed by the identifier prefix.</p>

    <section>
        <h3>Method Name</h3>
        <p>The method name that identifies this DID method SHALL be: <code>keri</code></p>

        A DID that uses this method MUST begin with the following prefix: <code>did:keri:</code>. Per the DID specification, this
        string MUST be in lowercase.  The remainder of the DID, after the prefix, is the method specific identifier (MSI) described below.

        <h3>Method Specific Identifier</h3>
        <p>The method specific identifier for the <tt>did:keri</tt> method is the prefix for a content self-addressing
            self-certifying identifier.  The derivation of such an identifier is described in detail in [[KERI]]</p>

        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>
            Creation of a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID is accomplished by creating, signing and publishing an Inception event. If witnesses are listed
            in the inception event, the receipts are also required for DID creation to be complete.
        </p>

        <p>
            Detailed steps are specified in [[KERI]]

            Steps to resolve a `did:keri:$PREFIX` DID:
        <ol>
            <li>Find the Key Event Log for the prefix `$PREFIX`.  The method for discovering the Key Event Log is outside the scope of
                this specification.  Possible implementations include the use of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), anchoring a KEL in a ledger or the use of a gossip
                protocol involving a witness network.
            </li>
            <li>Process the KEL into a Key State, according to the state validation rules/semantics of KERI as defined in [[KERI]]
            </li>
            <li>Create a DID Document with the DID `did:keri:$PREF`</li>
            <li>For each key K in the Key State, add a Verification Method to the DID Doc containing K and the
                appropriate type, with the ID of K being K's prefix form (alternatively, the ID could be an integer of
                K's index in the current signer list)
            </li>
            <li>Add the Key State as DID Document Metadata as defined in <a href="#resolvermetadata"></a>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>

            Establishment of control authority can be done independently of DID document contents, as long as the Key
            State is provided in the DID Document Metadata. See <a href="#resolvermetadata"></a> .

        <h3>Update</h3>
        <p>
            Updating a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID is accomplished by publishing establishment events to the KEL for performing operations
            such as key rotation and updating signature thresholds, witnesses and delegates.

        <h3>Deactivate</h3>
        <p>
            Deactivation of a <tt>did:keri</tt> DID consists of rotation to 0 controlling keys, which terminates the ability
            to recover the identifier and indicates that the identifier has been abandoned. Identifiers which are delegated
            to by an abandoned Identifier are also considered abandoned (delegating Ixn events can no longer be created).
