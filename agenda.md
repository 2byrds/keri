## Weekly Meeting Page

This page is for agendas and minutes of the weekly KERI-related work-item meetings of the Identifiers and Discovery (ID) Working Group, who are collaborating on topics related to DIDs and other identifiers. Meeting agendas are listed in reverse chronological order. Meetings will be recorded. This is an IPR-protected meeting, so please refrain from making substantial contributions orally on calls or on github before joining both DIF and the WG. You can get more information from the chairs or at [membership@identity.foundation](mailto:membership@identity.foundation). DIF membership info can be found [here](https://link.medium.com/PCtPmbHJV7).

Meeting Time: Every Tuesday, 10 am ET / 8 am MT (see DIF [google calendar](https://bit.ly/dif-calendar))

## Future/Pending Topics

- direct-mode interop updates post breaking changes
- replay mode refactor & witness logic rev

## Agenda 16 Feb

Use Case hour
- Guest lawyer to help with GDPR appendix to spec?
- Kid0001Comment updates
- Recommend reading: Keri versus CT [thread](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/issues/94)
    - might be helpful for spec authoring? non-normative appendix
    - cf also [did:orb](https://trustbloc.github.io/did-method-orb/#self-certifying-decentralized-identifiers) - might be good to be able to map their propagation and witnessing terminology to KERI's for public-facing documentation

Tech Talk:
- Test scripts
    - worth versioning Python so that test scripts could be commit-specific?
        - fractionally-weighted signatures and escrow not yet included in scripts
- Replay logic

GDPR issues
``
Q and A prio 1 General
 If you're using delegated id you have to delete the whole KEL?
 "tombstoning": the network can ask all nodes to ignore/not-process a dead identifier, which might not fulfill the right to erasure (even if it is right to be forgotten)
     - until this question is settled, KELs seem more definitive/compliant erasure
     - erasure corner case: if a legit request for erasure of identifier controlled by requestor comes in, but without keeping a "blocklist" of forgotten identifiers, I can't guarantee I won't replicate that KEL again later
         - Sam: as long as "internal" blacklist doesn't infringe, and erasure is only outward, this would seem to be fine?
``          

</summary>

## Agenda 9 Feb

Spec and Use case hour
- Interop test review:  Take time to run CLI demos and observe results
- Continued from last week: Priority [One Questions](https://hackmd.io/Q92qKx1iTsGo49O7U-dDOg)

Techtalk hour
- nextkey changes because of weighted threshold
    - new serialization - python extendable to all languages? delimited list of ratio strings
        - concat for arrays, ","s for lists (no brackets)
- Update Witnesses (ROT event) question
- "First seen" with escrowed multi-sig out-of-order events
- Replay design:  
    - Database timed log
        - escrow timeouts different per seq numbers
    - KID0001 commentary
    - Extended counter codes as composition operators
        - required to iterate test scripts
    - new table- actual, actual append-only meta-event log - monotonic timestamp (might require microseconds) and/or counter variable
        - this could end up with watcher timestamps being useful for conflict resolution (but not necessarily definitive)
            - "compliant" timestamping mechanism (python 3 has mechanisms to make timestamps tamper-evident)
            - Steve - timestamping only needed within synchronized network (for gossip and load-balancing, for example)
            - Sam: every p2p network (including public POW chains) propagate within milliseconds or maybe a second; the only risk is if duplicity or collusion happens in that tiny window of time;

Spec and Usecase Hour
- introductions
- Charter logistics (2 chairs, ready to email to SC)
- interop updated
    - who wants to screenshare
        - Philipp: Go Bob, Go sam and Go-eve running against Python on our side
            - running diff on both outputs showing essentially identical output
        - Charles: We haven't tested it yet
        - Test scripts
        - concat for arrays, ","s for lists (no brackets)
```
1/2,1/3&1,1 // --example-- use language-specific fractional library to simplify!
â†’ "kt":[["1/2","1/3"],["1",,"1"]] 
```

- Update Witnesses (ROT event) question
    - changing witnesses weakens security that witnesses provide on control authority proof; 
    - escrow race condition solved by replay design - sequence numbers can be superceded by recovery event (self-healing forks, as it were)
        - interaction events can't supercede recovery events, regardless of seq numbers
        - table missing from database: order that events are accepted into log- the actual actual append-only event log, lol-- needs to be checked by this event-recovery mechanism
- Seth: would log compaction help?
    - Kafka and other event systems use this to guarantee some amount of performance guarantees
    - Sam; watchers would love a "light" event log, they are happy to just use a merklized version; they only need the keystate and the hash of the most recent definitive event for each identifier watched; all the other stuff gets handled separately, in other logs and tables like escrow and duplicity-suspected log; 
    - Sam: sparse merkle trees were invented FOR CT originally :D
    - only controllers and witnesses and probably validators need to keep everyone's complete log; watchers don't
- "First seen" with escrowed multi-sig out-of-order events
    - Henk can you clarify the "first seen, verified" doctrine?
        - Until something is written into a KEL, it's not verified; escrow unverified by definition;
        - asynchrony required for performance reason; this requires escrowing anything with 1+/N required sigs; 
- Replay design:  
    - Database timed log
    - KID0001 commentary
    - Extended counter codes as composition operators

## Agenda 2 Feb

- KERI Use Cases: Feature lack of block chain use cases.
- KERI made easy
- Question about weighted thresholds: Normative requirement to use fractional libraries so as not to use floating point numbers but true ratio math.
- Approve Charter for KERI WG
- IDNum - potential KERI Use case. https://idnum.global (20 min, Tim)
- Review Escrow status
- Directmode interop? Re-run the scripts from IIW
    - Py "canonical" (to avoid NxN compat burden and blockages)
        - against "major release versions" of Py - SemVer
        - dummy data testvectors from sample KELs ?
            - currently interactive only-- escrow could handle async
            - would it make sense to replay logs one line per second?
    - anyone added delegation to those scripts yet?
    - disordered events to test escrow?
    - multisig?
    - weighted thresholds - OX already integrated
    - tests will be defined in the python demo modules in the form of Eve, Bob, Sam, etc.

Minutes
- Approve Charter for KERI WG
- IDNum - potential KERI Use case. https://idnum.global (20 min, Tim)
    - client = a telco with exclusive control of a mobile # range (only non-national number block)
    - we want to use global phone number range as basis of a personal digital identifier
        - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Personal_Telecommunications
        - risks inherent in phone numbers as identifiers
    - Sam: Correlation? You said its blinded or masked?
        - Tim: uses RCS; an "overlay" for your existing SIM (gloperspecs?) to temporarily route your global number to your local number; sending a secure transaction from a wallet would route via local #; reduced/fixed cost for numbers 
    - numbers allocated decentrally (maybe not even with a blockchain?); owned by individual for life
- Review Escrow status
    - too early for code walkthrough? are other people implementing escrow yet?
    - escrowXXevent - 5 types, 3 functions each
        +OO - 
        +UR unverified receipt - 
        +3 functions: decide to escrow, process chit, save/discard
    - discuss with go and rust people?
        + Philip: do you have a loop processing each event against escrows?
            - answer: processEscrows() - not currently using co-routines, but should/will process all Escrows in parallel using yields
            - answer: they timeout
        + py implementation is written with lmdb-- the IoVal functions handle the particularities
            - sidenote: 100% of db entries have a date/timestamp field, even if KERI doesn't do much with it
            - witnesses/watchers use/trust each other's timestamps - BUT can check against locally-saved timestamp
                - see for example processOutOfOrders in eventing.py ("blogger" refers to Splunk-style verbose logs)
- Interop timeline?
- Directmode interop? Re-run the scripts from IIW
    - Py "canonical" (to avoid NxN compat burden and blockages)
        - against "major release versions" of Py - SemVer
        - dummy data testvectors created from sample KELs ?
            - currently interactive only-- escrow could handle async
            - would it make sense to replay logs one line per second?
    - anyone added delegation to those scripts yet?
    - disordered events to test escrow?
        - same set of events sent in a diff order by a new identifier = tests all cases
        - canonical set of tests
    - multisig?
    - weighted thresholds - OX already integrated
        - Charles: fractions versus integers? floats are bad! deserialize?
            - Sam: integers need to be normalized to satisfy thresholds; 
            - Sam: use a fractional library! Charles: OK fine... (also, >=1, not =1)
        - Steve: is WT standardized at all?
            - Sam: Only one random blockchain I saw used it
        - Juan: Where's this go in the spec? Explicit requirement or non-normative guidance?
    - tests will be defined in the python demo modules in the form of Eve, Bob, Sam, etc.

- Q and A
    - database variations and assumptions? notes for non-normative considerations? I worry necessary details of the duplicity detection might be assumed but not specified...
    - custom KMS? (SCOIR)

## Agenda 26Jan

- [wG Charter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AJWHjo3gicUcuQyYPjnncE1cf1_nz0Nzi5R1cDtbYbU/edit)
    - ONE WEEK REVIEW PERIOD - 
        - suggest-mode in google doc plz
        - please voice your objections (or those of your employers' legal counsel) in #wg-KERI, or in private
- quick editorial question: what happened to the delegation permissions field in [this para-KID](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/kids/kid0003_compact_labels.md)?
- Update from Sam on escrow processing (//buffer)
    - keeps any event w/insuffic signatures in escrow until `kt` met
    - delegated event escrowed until delegation event received and vice versa
    - Seth's question re: dupl events: two insuff-signed events (with different signatures, 1+ of which might have been false and gets dropped)
        - Sam: Py has a "likely duplicitous" escrow? 
- Steve - Directmode documentation is out of date?
    - swim lane?
- New Count codes for Replay Mode (may break/block Indirect mode but not direct mode)
- How to use KERI in a mode that obviates DID Docs.  Or Why all we need is KERI
    - Did resolver metadata and VCs. 
    - A did doc is an ersatz VC. We can obviate with a real VC.

<details>
<summary>Minutes</summary>

- Introductions
    - new folks: Mikaela T and Philip F from (CANIS project)

- use case/spec hour notes

    - Sam: Delegation-enhanced recovery modes (WP 11.6; new WP (2.5.8) has 7.2.5, 11.6 cover this)
        - would be urgent to discuss if any implementers were already on recovery; no one (at least no one on the call) is there yet, tho.
        - review of cooperative delegation
    - Henk Q&A
1. [Not your keys...](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri/blob/master/docs/Q-and-A.md#not-your-keys-not-your-identity)
2. [relation KERI and VC model](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri/blob/master/docs/Q-and-A.md#does-a-keri-wallet-store-virtual-credentials-connect-to-my-identifiers)
    - Some source material in this [presentation](https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/presentations/GLEIF_with_KERI.web.pdf)
4. [DEL](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri/blob/master/docs/Q-and-A.md#duplicitous-event-log) 
    - is it normative?
    - Sam: Validators need to track DELs (and blame their authors) for incentive model
    - Henk: Could they be reconstructed later if deleted?
    - Sam: Someone needs to!
    - Sam: storing and publishing DELs is a community service 
5. [Cooperative Delegation](https://github.com/henkvancann/keri/blob/master/docs/Q-and-A.md#delegations-in-many-systems-are-unilateral-keri-has-cooperative-delegation-what-is-that-and-why-is-it-better)
6. Anything in Q&A that currently has the reference "_(@henkvancann)_" could use an expert review. Anyone editing the Q&A: please keep in mind it's targeted at newbies in the KERI field.

- tech talk
    - Extracted data algorithm uniqueness
        * something something breaking change to serialization
            * paging dr chunningham, your signoff is needed in surgery
    - Next commitment for fractionally weighted threshold
        * tour of some validateSigs & kevers breaking changes re: signing thresholds
    - Q & A
        * Henk: why must prefix be unique? Sam: hash comes from inception event; any semantically-significant change to inception event would create a diff hash and thus a diff identifier (the self-addressing part); only the inception event are susceptible to txn malleability attacks

- scheduling an interop demo by the end of jan? 2Feb in 3 weeks? Try doing it in-WG meeting two weeks from now?

## Agenda 5Jan

- Spec time
    - hackmd badges on each KID
    - whitepaper changes over vacation - seal events, new math diagram  

- dev time
    - Ox updates
    - Issue review on /keri/

        - VC Issuance against KERI SCIDs? Might need a later spec
        - Wallet Assumptions? Does that require a spec?
            - Charles - Universal Wallet spec could easily be extended to make a new API - I could write something up eventually
