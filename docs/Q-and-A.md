Inspired by presentation given and questions asked on the [SSI webinar May 2020](https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/), but also issues raised and the progress made, here on Github (Turn on 'Watch' if you want to be notified of conversations).

Beware: A Q&A is always *work in progress*. Tips & help welcome.

For practical reasons educational images uploaded by Github members have been downloaded. We de-personalised them by giving images a new name. Under these new names these images have been uploaded to github and used in the Q&A to clarify the questions and answers.

Parts of the video offered on SSI Meetup webinar 58 have been captured and uploaded to Github to support the answers to general questions about digital identity and more in depth answers to question about Keri.

We've done our best to protect the privacy of the Github by investigating the images we used. We haven't come across personal identifiable information (pii). However, should we have made a mistake after all, please let us know and we'll correct this immediately.

#### Agency
Agents can be people, edge computers and the functionality within [`wallets`](#digital-identity-wallet). The service an agent offers is agency.

#### Decentralized Identity
DID; {TBW}
#### Duplicity

#### External consistency

#### Internal consistency

#### Key Event Log

#### Key Event Receipt Log

#### Root of trust

#### (Digital Identity) Wallet
In our context it is software and sometimes hardware that serves as a key store and functionality. Keys can be private keys and public keys, hashes and pointers. Functionality can be signing, invoices (receive), send, virtual credentials, delegation, etc. This is the [`agency`](#agency) part of a wallet. <br/>

# Q&A section General

## What is KERI?
Key Event Receipt Infrastructure; a secure identifier overlay for the internet.

## Is KERI a DID?
KERI is not a DID method. The related DID method is [`did:un`](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri/blob/master/did_methods/un.md). A session at the recent **IIW31** presented by Jolocomâ€™s *Charles Cunningham* examines overlap between data models of DID documents and KERI identifiers [here](https://jolocom.io/blog/as-seen-at-iiw31-keri/).

## Why use KERI?
Because there is no secure universal trust layer for the internet, currently (2020).

## In what programming languages is KERI available?
In Python. It will be available in the coming year in Rust, Javascript and Go (2020).

## How KERI fit in [the 10 principles of SSI](https://medium.com/metadium/self-sovereign-identity-principle-6-portability-4a7105dd0381) by Christopher Allen?
KERI is not primarily about self-sovereign identity. KERI is primarily about autonomic identifiers, AIDs. That is identifiers that are self managing. KERI provides proof of control authority over the identifier. What one does with the identifier is not constrained by KERI. But because the primary root of trust of an AID is a KEL which can be hosted by any infrastructure, any identity system (SSI or otherwise) built on top of KERI may also be portable.  So IMHO  portability of the associated identifiers is essential to any truly self-sovereign identity system. That portability is not one of the principles is a defect in the principles.

# Q&A section KERI operational
## Where can I download KERI?
On (sub)page(s of) [github](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri)
# Q&A section Userinterface
## What does KERI look like?
Currently `KERI` is just code, that can be tested and executed in a terminal on the command line. Private key management of KERI will look like wallets and Key Event Logs and Key Event Receipt Log are files with lots of encrypted stuff in there.

# Q&A section Root of trust
## What do I need to trust in KERI?
Primary root of trust is KEL not secondary  (starts with self cert ID but then after first rotation if any must have KEL)

# Q&A section Private Key Management
# Q&A section Blockchain
## Does KERI use a blockchain?
No, but KERI uses the same cryptographical building blocks
## What's the difference between KERI and blockchain?
`KERI` is a unordered hash-linked list of signed Key Event logs and blockchain is a timestamped ordered list of hash-linked blocks of signed transactions. What this means:
1. we don't need ordering in `KERI` and that frees us from consensus protocols in blockchains
2. Hash-linking is done on a lower level in `KERI` and preserves consistency and fuels revealance of duplicity.
3. In `KERI` proofs are cryptographically derived from the root of trust, being the autonomous controller, in blockchains the root-of-trust is a transaction ledger.
