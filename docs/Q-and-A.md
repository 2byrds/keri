Inspired by presentation given and questions asked on the [SSI webinar May 2020](https://ssimeetup.org/key-event-receipt-infrastructure-keri-secure-identifier-overlay-internet-sam-smith-webinar-58/), but also issues raised and the progress made, here on Github (Turn on 'Watch' if you want to be notified of conversations).

Beware: A Q&A is always *work in progress*. Tips & help welcome.


### Disclaimer
None of the respondents in the **open** repo and presentations have been explicitly named as a source, except for ***Samuel M. Smith Ph.D.*** and ***@henkvancann***. For practical reasons educational images uploaded by Github members have been downloaded. We de-personalised them by giving images a new name. Under these new names these images have been uploaded to github and used in the Q&A to clarify the questions and answers.

Parts of the video offered on SSI Meetup webinar 58 have been captured and uploaded to Github to support the answers to general questions about digital identity and more in depth answers to question about Keri.

We've done our best to protect the privacy of the Github by investigating the images we used. We haven't come across personal identifiable information (pii). However, should we have made a mistake after all, please let us know and we'll correct this immediately.
