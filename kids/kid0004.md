### Introduction

A statement that includes the inception data with attached signature made with the private key comprises a cryptographic commitment to the derivation and configuration of the identifier that may be cryptographically verified by any entity that receives it. 

No additional infrastructure is needed or more importantly must be trusted in order to verify the derivation and initial configuration (inception) of the identifier. It is completely self-contained. The initial trust basis for the identifier is the signed inception statement. A diagram of a basic inception statement is shown below:

### Specification

Inception, self-certfying identifiers, derivation code, 

Practical use of a self-certifying identifier may (will?) require some initial configuration data (inception data). 

The inception data is formally represented in a signed inception statement.

Inception data MUST include:
 - the public key
 - the identifier derived from the public key.  
 
Identifier derivation MAY be represented by the derivation code (see: Derivation Code)

and MAY include:
 - other configuration data.
