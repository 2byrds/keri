## Introduction
(See WhitePaper Version 2.55)

There are two serialization algorithms needed for KERI. The first is the serialization of full events.  The second is the serialization of data sets extracted from a full event. 

In KERI, complete key events need to be serialized in order to create cryptographic signatures of each event. Complete events also need to be serialized in order to create cryptographic digests of each event. Complete events are propagated over the network in signed serialized form. Complete events also need to be de-serialized after network propagation such that the resultant de-serialization preserves the semantic structure of the data elements in the event. Because the cryptographic material in the events may be of variable length, a fixed field length serialization is not a viable approach. Consequently KERI must support variable length field serialization. Moreover serialization encodings that support arbitrary nested self-describing data structures provide future proofing to event composition. Notably, JSON, CBOR, and MsgPack are well known broadly supported serialization encodings that support arbitrary nested self-describing data structures. JSON is an ASCII text encoding that is human readable, albeit somewhat verbose, that is commonly used in web applications. On the other hand both CBOR and MsgPack are binary encodings that are much more compact. Supporting all three encodings (and possibly others) would satisfy a wide range of application, transport, and resource constaints. Importantly, because only the controller of the associated identifier prefix may compose KERI events, the ordering of elements in the event serialization may be determined solely by that controller. Other entities may sign the event serialization provided by the controller but do not need to provide a serialization of their own.

Within the KERI protocol cryptographic digests and signatures are created of specified subsets of the data elements extracted from complete KERI key events. Consequently these extracted data sets also need to be serialized. Importantly, however, the extracted data set serialization do not need to be propagated over the network. This means that the serializations do not need to preserve the semantic structure of the data. This allows extracted data serialization encoding to simplified. These digests of extracted data, however, need to be reproducible by any other entity. This means that the ordering of the data elements in the serialization must be exactly specified. 

In summary, the necessary constraint for complete event serialization is support for arbitrary data structures with variable length fields that are serializable and de-serializable in multiple formats. Reproducible ordering is not a necessary constraint. The necessary constraint for extracted data element sets is reproducible ordering but there is no need to de-serialize.

(see commentary for further rationale.)

## Event Serialization Algorthm

The ordering of elements in each mapping in each event element is specified (see below). This includes nested elements. Serialization using the standard JSON, CBOR, and MsgPack libraries follow a recursive depth first traversal of nested elements.

Complete events are serialized/de-serialized from/to ordered mappings using the JSON, CBOR or MsgPack functions for serializing/deserializing.  Each programming language may name the functions differently for serialization/de-serialization. In JavaScript they are JSON.stringify/JSON.parse. In Python they are json.dumps/json.loads. Likewise the CBOR and MsgPack libraries in each language may use different names for these functions.

The JSON serialization is without white space.

## Extracted Data Set Serializaton

The extracted data set serialization algorithm serializes the elements in each set using the same order of appearance as the associated event. Nested elements are serialized using a depth first traversal.

The serialization appends (concatenates) the serialized value of each element as it encounters it. Each element value is serialized as a UTF-8 encoded string of characters. 

Each implementation must perform the recursive depth first traversal.

In order to ensure that the extracted serializations are unique, the values or value sets must be unique. Uniqueness may be obtained by some combination of unique values and unique ordering of values. In most cases the ordering is explicit which may by itself ensure that the serialization is unique. Any change in a value at a location changes serialization of the set of values. However, the data element list  and the perm list in a delegation do not have a predefined ordering of their enclosed mappings. This means that that associated values must either be unique or must appear in a mapping with a unique combination of values. Seal values include crptographic digests which are unique.

## Event Ordered Element Sets

As of this writing KERI has 5 different types of key events with corresponding message dictionaries and unique message types or ilks, these are:

Inception Event  
Rotation Event  
Interaction Event  
Delegated Inception Event  
Delegated Rotation Event  

In addition to the key event messages KERI has several other messages such as receipt and notification messages each with corresponding message dictionaries and unique message types or ilks, these are:

Event Receipt Message, Nontransferable Signer  
Event Receipt Message, Transferable Signer
Key State Notification


Each event may have slightly different sets of elements. The events are expressed as an ordered mapping of (label, value) pairs. The values may include lists (arrays) of values or (label, value) pairs or nested ordered mappings of (label, value) pairs.

An Interaction event in a delegated key event stream has the identical element set of an interaction event in a non-delegated key event stream. As a result the ordering from the non-delegated interaction event may be applied to the delegated interaction event. 

In the following specifications the element sets are expressed in JSON format. Both MsgPack and CBOR natively support JSON compatible field element values for the various data types as well as ascii field element labels. As a result a JSON constrained representation is sufficient to ensure interoperabilty.

### Element Labels

vs   = version string (all)  
pre  = autonomic identifier prefix (all)  
sn   = sequence number (all)  
ilk  = event ilk type (all)  
dig  = digest previous event (rot, ixn, drt)  
sith = signing threshold or list of weighted thresholds (icp, rot, dip, drt)  
keys = list of signing public keys (icp, rot, dip, drt)  
nxt  = next digest of ensuing threshold and signers (icp, rot, dip, drt)  
toad = witness threshold of accountable duplicity  tally (icp, rot, dip, drt)  
wits = witness list of aid prefixes (icp, dip)  
cuts = witness cut prune list (rot, drt)  
adds = witness add graft list (rot, drt)  
cnfg = config data list (icp)   
data = data seal list (rot, ixn)  
perm = list of ordered mappings of delegation permissions (dip, drt)  
seal = delegation seal (dip, drt)  


### Version String

Version string enables discovery of encoding when parsing serialized
packet.


Parts:
    KERI version kind size terminal
    
    KERI = KERI event packet identifier
    version = major minor = hex characters = 10 for 1.0
    kind  = encoding one of CBOR, JSOM, MGPK
    size = 6 character hex string length of serialized event 
           max size 16777215 bytes in version 1.0
    terminal is "_" underscore for future proofing


version tuple = (1, 0) = (major, minor)

major increments with backward breaking changes
minor increments with backward compatible changes

Serialize event with 0000 size value in version string.

Terminal characters enables detectable parsable change in length of version string in the future

Embedded version string with size obviates the needed for 
separate header when using headerless transports (not http).
Because version string is embedded in event it is included in signed portion so is protected by authentication of signature.
An attacker may not change the size of the event without breaking the signature.

Serialize event with zero'd size in version string

```
KERI10CBOR000000_
KERI10JSON000000_
KERI10MGPK000000_
```

Then replace the 000000 size field inside the version string  of the serialized event with lowercase hex of actual size of serialized event.

```
KERI10CBOR000115_
KERI10JSON00011c_
KERI10MGPK000115_
```

Then sign the encoded event that now has the correct size in its version string.

### Mutually Exclusive Multi-Type Support

Two event elements values may be of more than one type. The design decision was primarily practical. Although the idea of multiple types of values for a given element label introduces complexity it was less complexity then adding an additional element with unique label for each type.  

This trade-off happens with the value types are mutually exclusive. This means that should there be two different labels one for each type, then the presence of both labels must be handled. This is either an error or there must be a prioritization of
the labels. If both are present the implementation must decide which one is to be used. Clearly both should never be present so its an error. There is no way to infer the intent of the provider. But how best to enforce the error?  

The code to enforce mutual exclusivity is at least as complex as the code to do a type check switch.  In either case, because both types must separably supported, the code to support both types after the switch or prioritization is the same. But having only one field label with more than one type value means there is no chance of prioritization errors due to ambiguity of intent. One field forces zero ambiguity of intent. In languages like Python that are duck typed, the consensus is that a type switch is preferred to multiple fields.  

In general, an event's serialization should not be the operative representation. This distinction is not a problem for most languages, but does arise frequently in JavaScript where JSON is so closely tied to the operative representation. In non JavaScript implementations extraction from a serialization should handle the type switch and if desirable the representation after extraction may have multiple attribute labels, one for each value type.

In conclusion, the design decision here is that an or-ing of value types in a serialization field element where those value types are mutually exclusive is practically less error prone and less complex than adding mutually exclusive field labels, one for each value type to the serialization.

### Non-Transferable Streaming Event Receipt Message with Attached Receipt Couplets

This receipt message may be generated by entities whose identifier prefix uses a non-transferable derivation code, i.e. ephemeral. This allows verification of the signature merely from the identifier prefix in the attached receipt couplet. This type of receipt may be used by witnesses, watchers who by design have non-transferable prefixes and by validators with non-transferable prefixes. Validators with transferable prefixes must use a different receipt message kind (see transferable receipt below ). Because each item of fully qualified cryptographic material in KERI is self-framing we may provide the receipt signatures as attached couplets. This is most compatible with streaming transport like the other KERI events. In this case we simply attach, after the receipt statement, a sequence of couplets where each couplet consists of the concatenation of the fully qualified Base64 representations of a given witness identifier prefix and the associated witness signature. In the case where the full message plus attached couplets are not framed into a packet (i.e. TCP),  then a counter code (CryCounter) may be inserted after the event but before the first receipt couplet to indicate the number of attached couplets.  

vs is version of receipt  
pre is identifier prefix of event of receipt  
sn is sequence number of event of receipt  
ilk is rct i.e. receipt  
dig is digest of event of receipt  

```javascript
{
  "vs"   : "KERI10JSON00011c_",

```

### Transferable Streaming Event Receipt Message with Attached Signatures

This receipt message may be generated by entities whose identifier prefix uses a transferable derivation code, i.e. non-ephemeral. This requires a full KEL of the receipting entity's prefix. This type of receipt may be used by validators with transferable prefixes. Because each item of fully qualified cryptographic material in KERI is self-framing we may attach the signatures. This is most compatible with streaming transport like the other KERI events. In this case we simply attach, after the receipt statement, a sequence of indexed signatures. One signatures for each key in the current signing key set for the receipting prefix.  In the case where the full message plus attached signatures are not framed into a packet (i.e. TCP),  then a counter code (SigCounter) may be inserted after the event but before the first receipt couplet to indicate the number of attached couplets. The receipt includes an event seal to the last establishment event in the receipting prefix's KEL. The receipt is verified against the current set of keys provided by the latest establishment event when the receipt is received by the controller.  

vs is version of receipt  
pre is identifier prefix of event being receipted  
sn is sequence number of event being receipted  
ilk is rct i.e. receipt  
dig is digest of event being receipted  
seal is event seal of latest establishment event of validator at time receipt created. Pre in seal is identifier prefix of validator creating receipt. Did in seal is digest of validtor's latest establishment event in order to determine signing keys for attached signatures  

```javascript
{
  "vs"   : "KERI10JSON00011c_",
  "pre"  : "AaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM",  // qualified Base64
  "sn"   : "1",  // lowercase hex string no leading zeros
  "ilk"  : "vrc", 
  "dig"  : "DZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvaU6JR2nmwyYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM",  // qualified Base64 Optional
  "seal" :
          {
             "pre"  : "AYAfSVPzhzS6b5CMaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULv",  // qual Base64
             "dig" : "DZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvaU6JR2nmwyYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM",  // prior dig qual Base64
           }
}
```

### Enveloped Non-Transferable Event Receipt Message (non-transferable)

(optional) Some web application interfaces might find an enveloped message more convenient. In this case the receipt signatures are embedded in the message itself. This is not as efficient as the streaming format of the version above.


```javascript
{
  "vs"   : "KERI10JSON00011c_",
  "pre"  : "AaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM",  // qualified Base64
  "sn"   : "1",  // lowercase hex string no leading zeros
  "ilk"  : "rct",
  "dig"  : "DZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvaU6JR2nmwyYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM",  // qualified Base64 Optional
  "wits" : // list qualified Base64 prefixes of witnesses, watchers, validators
           [ 
             "AaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM", 
             "AmwyZ-i0d8JZaU6JR2nAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM"
           ],   
  "sigs" : // list qualified Base64 signatures, one per witness in order
           [
             "0BSb9qBNXUerVs4IDYnai29AXcPQJtudLPfzfvehicA7LrswWBPmNlNQK9gIJB4pny2YpuB3m6-pgyl4cU65RRCA",
             "0BIJB4pny2YpuB3m6-pgyl4cU65RRCASb9qBNXUerVs4IDYnai29AXcPQJtudLPfzfvehicA7LrswWBPmNlNQK9g"
           ]
}

```

## Ordered Extracted Data Element Set Labels

The lists provide the order that the values from the respective data elements are to be combined in the extracted serialized data. Unless specified otherwise the combination is by concatenation. When the data element value is itself a collection of data elements such as a list or mapping then the elements of the
collection that is the value are to be combined in the order of appearance in the collection. This rule must be recursively applied. 

For example the current signing keys element is itself a list.  So each key from the "keys" element is concatenated in order of appearance in the "keys" list. The "sith" element may also be a list or list of lists when using a fractionally weighted threshold.




### Prefix Derivation Data from Inception Event Labels

Excluded element labels.  This allows future proofing in that other elements included in inception event do not break derivation. All elements
in order of appearance in event are included except the excluded elements listed below.  

```javascript
[
  "pre",
]

```


### Delegated Prefix Derivation Data from Delegated Inception Event Labels

Excluded element labels.  This allows future proofing in that other elements included in inception event do not break derivation. All elements
in order of appearance in event are included except the excluded elements listed below.  


```javascript
[
  "pre",    // delegated event
]

```

## Inception Configuration Traits

The naming of these as a "trait" was orginally motivated by a desire to avoid confusion with  the words attribute and property refer to elements associated with objects (namely Python objects). However in other languages like Rust the word trait is also used. Another synonym "aspect" is used in other languages as well. So given there may not be a word with conflict, trait, is used because it is short. Given that the curren trait is a constraint a suggested approch is to change the term to "curb" which does not conflict with any language terms.

Inception configuration traits only show up in the 'cnfg' element of the inception and delegated inception events.

So far the only configuation trait defined for KERI is the following:

```python
'EstOnly'
```

The inception EstOnly trait, when present places a constraint on the key event stream that only allows  establishment events. Or in other words interaction events are not allowed. This provides the best case security because signing keys become one use only and therefore minimizes the potential for exploit of signing keys.

To apply a trait include a mapping of the following form in the cnfg element list. Where the mapping has one element with key = 'trait' and value is the trait string. In this case value = 'EstOnly'. For example:

```json
{

"confg": [{"trait":  "EstOnly"}]
}
```

Each trait string must be unique.

In delegated inception events additional traits may be defined for constraints on permissions. A suggested constraint maybe "DoNotDelegate" or "NoDel" to forbid the delegated event stream from creating delegations of other event streams.



## JavaScript Ordered Object Property Serialization

The following code snippet shows how to enforce object property creation order preserving serialization using JSON.stringify for ES6 and later.

### Code Snippet

```javascript
"use strict"

// Spec http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-json.stringify
const replacer = (key, value) =>
  value instanceof Object && !(value instanceof Array) ? 
    Reflect.ownKeys(value)
    .reduce((ordered, key) => {
      ordered[key] = value[key];
      return ordered 
    }, {}) :
    value;

// Usage

// JSON.stringify({c: 1, a: { d: 0, c: 1, e: {a: 0, 1: 4}}}, replacer);


var main = function() 
{
    console.log("Running Main.");
    
    let x = { zip: 3, apple: 1, bulk: 2, _dog: 4 };
    let y = JSON.stringify(x);
    console.log(y);
    console.log(Object.keys(x));
    console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(x));
    console.log(Reflect.ownKeys(x));
    console.log(replacer);
    let w  = {w: 1, a: x, c: {e: 2, b: 3}};
    let z = JSON.stringify(x, replacer);
    console.log(z);
    let v = JSON.stringify(w, replacer);
    console.log(v);
    
}

if (require.main === module) 
{
    main();
}


//nodejs % node play.js
//Running Main.
//{"zip":3,"apple":1,"bulk":2,"_dog":4}
//[ 'zip', 'apple', 'bulk', '_dog' ]
//[ 'zip', 'apple', 'bulk', '_dog' ]
//[ 'zip', 'apple', 'bulk', '_dog' ]
//[Function: replacer]
//{"zip":3,"apple":1,"bulk":2,"_dog":4}
//{"w":1,"a":{"zip":3,"apple":1,"bulk":2,"_dog":4},"c":{"e":2,"b":3}}

```

### Background

We may impose ordered serialization with the JSON.stringify method  by using the replacer  option and the [[ownPropertyKeys]] internal method added in Javascript ES6 exposed as Reflect.ownKeys().  This method is provided in JavaScript ES6 (2015). [[ownPropertyKeys]] uses the property creation order.  At the time of ES6, JSON.stringify was not required to use the [[ownPropertyKeys]] iteration order (ie property creation order). This appears to have been fixed in later versions of ES. (See the discussion below). As of this writing nodejs v14.2.0 and the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and Firefox all appear to preserve property creation order  in JSON.stringify(). This means that we can depend on and use that ordering in the specification.  For earlier versions but still with support ES6, a custom replacer function for JSON.stringify(x, replacer) will ensure that property creation order is used.  Earlier versions that do not support ES6 may still work with an ES6 polyfill if that includes support for [[ownPropertyKeys]].

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30076219/does-es6-introduce-a-well-defined-order-of-enumeration-for-object-properties/30919039

In ES6 the stringify order is not required to follow the ownPropertyKeys (property creation order) ordering but this will be fixed in ES 2020. ES11.  It appears that the  Babel polyfill as of 2020 already supports ES2020 already.

Reflect.ownKeys ( target )

This has already been discussed a tiny bit in this article, you see Reflect.ownKeys implements [[OwnPropertyKeys]] which if you recall above is a combination of Object.getOwnPropertyNames and Object.getOwnPropertySymbols. This makes Reflect.ownKeys uniquely useful. Lets see shall we:

```javascript


var myObject = {
  foo: 1,
  bar: 2,
  [Symbol.for('baz')]: 3,
  [Symbol.for('bing')]: 4,
};

assert.deepEqual(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject), ['foo', 'bar']);
assert.deepEqual(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(myObject), [Symbol.for('baz'), Symbol.for('bing')]);

// Without Reflect.ownKeys:
var keys = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(myObject).concat(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(myObject));
assert.deepEqual(keys, ['foo', 'bar', Symbol.for('baz'), Symbol.for('bing')]);

// With Reflect.ownKeys:
assert.deepEqual(Reflect.ownKeys(myObject), ['foo', 'bar', Symbol.for('baz'), Symbol.for('bing')]);


```
